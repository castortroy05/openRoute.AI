# Contributing to OpenRoute.ai

First off, thank you for considering contributing to OpenRoute.ai. 

### 1. Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make the first step and search issue tracker here on GitHub for existing issues. If you cannot find a suitable issue and want to create a new one, please be sure to include a clear title and description.

### 2. Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork OpenRoute.ai and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```sh
git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-translations
```

### 3. Get the code

The first thing you'll need to do is to fork the repository and clone it to your local machine. See [GitHub help page](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) for help.

### 4. Code Guidelines

- Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
- Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.

### 5. Did you find a bug?

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/openroute.ai/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/yourusername/openroute.ai/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### 6. Make Changes

Now, go ahead and make your changes, keeping in mind the following guidelines:

- Keep your changes as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write descriptive commit messages. This helps others to understand the history of your work.

### 7. Test Your Changes

This is important to ensure your changes don't break anything and ensures the quality of the project.

### 8. Submit a Pull Request

Once you've pushed your branch to GitHub, you're ready to [submit a pull request](https://github.com/yourusername/openroute.ai/pulls). At this point, you'll want to ensure that your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Title your pull request in a way that is consistent with the project's naming conventions.
- Describe your pull request in detail, providing context for every change you're making.

### 9. What happens next?

At this point, you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

### 10. Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted
